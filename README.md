# Interactive Handwritten Digit Classifier Website
A website that can classify handwritten digit in real-time using a neural network.

The neural network is trained with the MNIST dataset in Python with Tensorflow.

Either a dense neural network or a convolutional neural network will do the trick.

The model parameters of the trained neural network is saved and integrated into the frontend using Tensorflow.js
